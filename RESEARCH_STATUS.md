## Phase 1 current state
- Primary source: thetrademarkk/india-index-options-1m.
- Source revision is pinned to immutable Hugging Face commit 0f4800e.
- Prior structural acquisition on mutable main downloaded 269 parquet files and passed corrected structural validation; it remains historical evidence only.
- Production workflow now uses the pinned revision and separate cache restore/save steps.
- Historical bid/ask is not documented in the primary source; execution is currently classified as degraded unless an independent historical quote source is validated.
- NSE contract-rule changes and Paytm Money date/cohort-dependent costs have been externally reconciled at source-review level.
- Interim acceptance report: research/PHASE1_ACCEPTANCE_REPORT.md.
- No backtest engine, optimization, or profitability conclusion has started.

## Open Phase 1 gates
1. Re-run structural validation against the pinned revision and record immutable file provenance.
2. Quantify timestamp/coverage gaps, missing bars and stale observations.
3. Quantify underlying/option timestamp alignment.
4. Reconstruct Greeks under the frozen Phase 0 IV/Black-Scholes contract and report solver success/failure.
5. Quantify target-delta strike availability under the frozen ±0.05 tolerance and liquidity rules.
6. Reconcile historical expiry, lot-size and tick-size metadata against effective-date NSE references.
7. Reconcile date-specific Paytm Money brokerage and statutory/exchange charges.
8. Collect and align contextual regime variables: NIFTY, India VIX, FII/FPI, DII, GIFT NIFTY/overnight, global risk/volatility, NSE/BSE and relevant events.
9. Obtain independent tester PASS for the final Phase 1 branch.
